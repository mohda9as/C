Car Rental System Project :-

This Java application is a demonstration of robust software engineering, built to manage a complete car rental workflow using pure Object-Oriented Programming principles. It provides a clean, modular foundation for handling a fleet of vehicles, customer accounts, rental transactions, and dynamic pricing.

Project Structure:-

src:-

    # Application entry point
    # Core domain entities and business logic
    # Abstract base class for all vehicles
    # Concrete class for standard vehicles
    # Concrete class for luxury vehicles (premium pricing)
    # Entity representing a customer
    # Entity representing a rental contract
    # Singleton core system (facade)
      

Features:-

The Car Rental System offers several key features designed with extensibility in mind: 

#Fleet Management: Seamlessly add and manage different types of vehicles (Standard, Luxury) to your rental fleet.  

#Customer Registry: Register and manage customer accounts with essential details.  

#Rental Processing: Handle the complete rental lifecycleâ€”check car availability, create rental agreements for specific date ranges, and calculate costs. 

#Polymorphic Pricing: The system automatically applies the correct pricing model. Luxury cars incur a premium surcharge, demonstrating dynamic behavior.

#Invoice Generation: Automatically generate detailed invoices upon vehicle return, summarizing the rental period and total cost. 

#OOP Demonstration: A practical showcase of Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

Technologies Used :-

This project uses Java for the main application logic. It employs JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database interactions and MySQL (or another database system) for data storage.
